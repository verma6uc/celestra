3. Core Components
3.1 LLM Integration Layer
LLM Interface Management
The LLM Interface Management component serves as the critical bridge between the agentic application and Large Language Model services. Its primary purpose is to ensure reliable, efficient, and controlled interactions with LLM providers while maintaining system robustness and performance.
1. Interface Architecture
The interface architecture establishes the fundamental structure for LLM communication, focusing on reliability and fault tolerance.
Purpose:
Provide stable and consistent access to LLM capabilities
Manage service provider relationships
Ensure system resilience through fallback mechanisms
Control resource utilization and costs
Core Configuration:
{
    "model_config": {
        "primary_model": {
            "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
            "model_id": "gpt-4",
            "timeout": 30,
            "retry_attempts": 3,
            "max_tokens": 4096
        },
        "fallback_model": {
            "endpoint": "/v1/completions",
            "model_id": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            "timeout": 15,
            "retry_attempts": 2
        }
    }
}
This configuration structure supports:
Multiple model configurations for different use cases
Fallback mechanisms for system resilience
Flexible timeout and retry policies
Resource utilization controls
2. Request Management
Request Management handles the formation, validation, and delivery of prompts to the LLM service, ensuring quality and efficiency in communications. 
Key Responsibilities:
Request Formation
Construct properly formatted prompts
Maintain conversation context
Handle message sequencing
Manage system instructions
Context Management
Track conversation history
Implement context windowing
Manage token budgets
Handle context overflow
Validation
Verify request format
Check token limits
Validate content safety
Ensure schema compliance

Implementation:
1. Conversation Management
The system maintains each conversation as a unique interaction stream:
Each conversation gets a unique identifier (UUID)
Messages are stored in chronological order
Each message includes sender role, content, and timing
Additional metadata can be attached to messages for context
2. Context Window Management
The system intelligently manages conversation context through:
A sliding window of recent messages that acts like short-term memory
Maximum limits on both number of messages and total tokens
Automatic removal of older messages when limits are reached
Preservation of critical context while managing memory constraints
3. Token Management
Token usage is carefully tracked and managed:
Continuous counting of tokens in the conversation
Pre-checking if new messages would exceed limits
Automatic trimming of older context when needed
Maintaining space for responses within token limits
Key Processes
1. Adding New Messages
When a new message is added to the conversation:
First calculates how many tokens the message will use
Checks if adding it would exceed the maximum token limit
If needed, removes older messages to make space
Adds the new message with metadata and timestamp
Updates the running token count
2. Context Trimming
When the context needs to be reduced:
Identifies how much space is needed for new content
Removes oldest messages first while tracking tokens freed
Continues until enough space is available
Maintains a record of removed context
Raises an error if cannot make enough space
3. Request Preparation
Before sending to the LLM:
Assembles all relevant messages from the context window
Adds system configuration parameters
Structures the request in the required format
Includes any special instructions or response formats
Prepares metadata for tracking and logging
4. Request Validation
Performs comprehensive checks including:
Verifies message sequence makes logical sense
Ensures content meets safety requirements
Confirms token counts are within limits
Validates any special formatting requirements
Checks for required components (system instructions, etc.)
Error Handling
The system handles several types of potential issues:
Context Overflow: When too much context accumulates
Token Limits: When approaching or exceeding token boundaries
Invalid Sequences: When message patterns don't make sense
Content Issues: When content fails safety checks
Configuration Problems: When system settings are invalid

4. Context Management
Context Management handles the crucial task of maintaining, updating, and optimizing the conversation context for LLM interactions. It ensures relevant information is preserved while managing token usage and maintaining conversation coherence.
1. Context Handling Processes
A. Message Processing
Each new message is processed for context inclusion
Importance scores are calculated
Token counts are determined
Metadata is preserved
Timestamps are added
B. Context Updates
New messages are integrated into existing context
Token limits are monitored
Least important messages are removed when needed
Context coherence is maintained
C. Context Optimization
Messages are scored based on importance and recency
Context is trimmed to fit token limits
Most relevant information is preserved
Context coherence is ensured
2. Importance Calculation
The system determines message importance based on:
Message role (system, user, assistant)
Content relevance to current topic
Recency of message
Explicit importance markers
Relationship to current goal
3. Token Management
Token usage is managed through:
Continuous token counting
Proactive context trimming
Importance-based message removal
Token budget allocation
Context optimization
4. Context Storage
The system maintains context through:
Per-conversation context storage
Efficient retrieval mechanisms
Context versioning
Metadata preservation
Quick access optimization
Detailed Implementation Example
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self, config: ContextConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.max_tokens = config.max_tokens
        self.current_context = deque(maxlen=config.max_messages)
