# Authentication Module Implementation Tasks

## Initial Analysis and Setup

- [x] **Review Database Schema**
  - **Why**: A thorough understanding of the database structure is essential before implementing authentication features.
  - **What**: Carefully review the SQL schema file to understand:
    - User table structure and related tables (invitations, sessions, password_history, etc.)
    - Security-related tables (audit_logs, failed_logins, user_lockouts)
    - Enum types for status tracking
    - Relationships between tables and foreign key constraints
    - Indexes and performance considerations

- [x] **Create Authentication Configuration**
  - **Why**: Centralizing authentication settings makes the system more maintainable and configurable.
  - **What**: Create a configuration file/class that defines:
    - Password complexity requirements
    - Lockout thresholds and durations
    - Session expiration timeframes
    - Token expiration settings (for password reset, invitations)
    - Security-related timeouts

## Core User Management

- [x] **Extend Existing User DAO**
  - **Why**: The existing UserDAO needs to be enhanced to support authentication-specific operations.
  - **What**: Add methods to the existing UserDAO for:
    - Authentication-specific queries
    - Status validation and updates
    - Role checking and management
    - Password handling and verification
    - Session-related user operations

- [x] **Implement Registration Service**
  - **Why**: A dedicated service encapsulates the business logic for user registration.
  - **What**: Create a registration service that:
    - Validates user input
    - Enforces password complexity rules
    - Handles different registration flows (direct, invitation-based)
    - Creates appropriate user records with proper role assignment
    - Associates users with companies (except for super admins)
    - Generates audit logs for account creation

## Authentication Implementation

- [x] **Implement Password Security Utilities**
  - **Why**: Proper password handling is critical for system security.
  - **What**: Create utilities for:
    - Secure password hashing with modern algorithms
    - Password validation against complexity requirements
    - Password history checking to prevent reuse
    - Password strength evaluation

- [x] **Implement Login Service**
  - **Why**: Centralizing login logic ensures consistent security policies.
  - **What**: Create a login service that:
    - Validates credentials
    - Handles authentication failures
    - Tracks failed login attempts
    - Implements account lockout logic
    - Creates user sessions
    - Generates appropriate audit logs
    - Handles IP address tracking
    - Checks company status for non-super admin users

- [x] **Implement Session Management**
  - **Why**: Proper session handling is essential for maintaining authenticated state securely.
  - **What**: Create session management functionality that:
    - Generates secure session tokens
    - Creates session records in the database
    - Sets appropriate expiration times
    - Provides validation methods for active sessions
    - Handles session termination
    - Note: No automatic cleanup of expired sessions is required

## Password Recovery Flows

- [x] **Implement Forgot Password Service**
  - **Why**: Users need a secure way to recover access when they forget their password.
  - **What**: Create a service that:
    - Handles forgot password requests by email
    - Generates secure reset tokens with appropriate expiration
    - Sends email with a password reset link
    - Validates user existence without revealing account information
    - Records appropriate audit logs

- [x] **Implement Reset Password Service**
  - **Why**: A secure password reset process is needed to complete the recovery flow.
  - **What**: Create a service that:
    - Validates reset tokens
    - Enforces password history policies
    - Updates user passwords securely
    - Invalidates the used token
    - Logs all password changes
    - Optionally terminates existing sessions
    - Sends password changed notifications

## Security Infrastructure

- [x] **Implement Failed Login Tracking**
  - **Why**: Tracking failed attempts helps prevent brute force attacks.
  - **What**: Create functionality that:
    - Records failed login attempts
    - Associates attempts with users when possible
    - Tracks IP addresses
    - Implements threshold detection
    - Triggers account lockouts when needed

- [x] **Implement User Lockout System**
  - **Why**: Account lockouts protect against persistent attack attempts.
  - **What**: Create a lockout system that:
    - Creates lockout records based on security policy
    - Sets appropriate temporary or permanent lockouts
    - Provides methods to check lockout status
    - Implements automatic and manual unlocking procedures
    - Records lockout events in audit logs

- [x] **Implement Comprehensive Audit Logging**
  - **Why**: Audit trails are essential for security monitoring and compliance.
  - **What**: Create audit logging that:
    - Records all authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
    - Tracks password changes and resets
    - Documents account status changes
    - Implements digital signatures for log integrity
    - Records detailed before/after values for critical changes

## Invitation System

- [x] **Implement Invitation Service**
  - **Why**: Invitations provide a controlled way to onboard new users.
  - **What**: Create an invitation service that:
    - Generates secure invitation tokens
    - Sets appropriate expiration times
    - Updates invitation status throughout the process
    - Handles invitation cancellation
    - Provides resend capabilities
    - Records invitation events in audit logs

- [x] **Implement Invitation Acceptance Flow**
  - **Why**: A secure acceptance flow completes the invitation process.
  - **What**: Create functionality that:
    - Validates invitation tokens
    - Guides users through account setup
    - Enforces password requirements
    - Activates user accounts upon completion
    - Updates invitation status
    - Records acceptance in audit logs

## Authorization System

- [ ] **Implement Role-Based Authorization**
  - **Why**: Different user types need different access levels.
  - **What**: Create an authorization system that:
    - Defines permissions for each role
    - Provides methods to check permissions
    - Implements access control helpers
    - Separates super admin capabilities from other roles
    - Handles company-specific permissions

- [ ] **Create Security Filter/Interceptor**
  - **Why**: A centralized security filter enforces authentication and authorization rules.
  - **What**: Create a filter/interceptor that:
    - Validates active sessions
    - Checks user permissions against requested resources
    - Handles authentication failures
    - Redirects to login when needed
    - Provides security context to application components

## Testing

  - **Why**: Testing ensures the authentication system works correctly and securely.
  - **What**: Create comprehensive tests for:
    - User registration flows
    - Login processes
    - Password recovery
    - Session management
    - Lockout mechanisms
    - Role-based access control
