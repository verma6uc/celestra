# Data Seeding Tasks

## Analysis and Planning

- [x] **Analyze database schema structure**
  - **Why**: Understanding the schema structure is essential for creating a proper seeding plan that respects table relationships and constraints.
  - **What**: Carefully review the SQL file at `/Users/nupurbhaisare/celestra-workspace/celestra/docs/db/schema.sql` to:
    - Identify all tables and their relationships
    - Note primary and foreign key constraints
    - Understand data types and constraints for each column
    - Identify required vs. optional fields
    - Document enum values and their constraints

- [x] **Review application features to understand data requirements**
  - **Why**: The seeded data should support the application features and use cases to enable effective testing and demonstration.
  - **What**: Read the feature documentation in `/Users/nupurbhaisare/celestra-workspace/celestra/docs/features` to:
    - Understand how each table is used in the application
    - Identify important data patterns and business rules
    - Note any specific data requirements for testing key features
    - Understand the expected volume and variety of data needed

- [x] **Create comprehensive data seeding plan**
  - **Why**: A detailed plan ensures data is inserted in the correct order, with appropriate relationships, and in a way that supports application features.
  - **What**: Develop a seeding plan document that includes:
    - Tables listed in insertion order (respecting foreign key constraints)
    - Volume of data to insert for each table
    - Specific Faker methods to use for each column type
    - Strategy for generating related records across tables
    - Handling of enum values and other constrained fields
    - Approach for generating realistic data patterns that support features
    - Special cases or custom data generation requirements

## Implementation

- [x] **Set up seeding utilities**
  - **Why**: Helper utilities will make the seeding process more consistent and efficient.
  - **What**: Implement utility methods that:
    - Leverage the existing database connection
    - Provide helper methods for batch insertions
    - Configure and initialize the Faker library
    - Include error handling and logging for seeding operations

- [ ] **Implement seeding classes for independent tables**
  - **Why**: Tables without foreign key dependencies should be seeded first.
  - **What**: Create Java classes that:
    - Generate appropriate fake data using Faker
    - Handle any table-specific constraints or business rules
    - Perform bulk inserts for efficiency
    - Include progress reporting and error handling

- [ ] **Implement seeding classes for dependent tables**
  - **Why**: Tables with foreign key dependencies must be seeded after their parent tables.
  - **What**: Create Java classes that:
    - Query for existing IDs from parent tables
    - Generate appropriate fake data with valid relationships
    - Handle complex relationship patterns (one-to-many, many-to-many)
    - Perform bulk inserts while maintaining referential integrity
    - Include progress reporting and error handling

- [ ] **Create master seeding coordinator class**
  - **Why**: A coordinator ensures tables are seeded in the correct order and provides a unified interface for the seeding process.
  - **What**: Implement a coordinator class that:
    - Executes individual seeding classes in the proper sequence
    - Handles dependencies between seeding operations
    - Provides overall progress reporting
    - Includes transaction management for data consistency
    - Offers options for full or partial seeding

## Execution and Verification

- [ ] **Execute seeding process for each table**
  - **Why**: Seeding tables one by one allows for better control and troubleshooting.
  - **What**: Run each seeding class individually:
    - Start with independent tables
    - Proceed to dependent tables in the correct order
    - Monitor for errors or constraint violations
    - Verify data volume meets requirements

- [ ] **Troubleshoot and fix any seeding issues**
  - **Why**: Error handling ensures data integrity and complete seeding.
  - **What**: For any errors encountered:
    - Analyze error messages and stack traces
    - Review database constraints that might be violated
    - Fix data generation logic to comply with constraints
    - Adjust seeding approach for problematic tables
    - Re-run failed seeding operations

- [ ] **Verify seeded data meets application requirements**
  - **Why**: Confirmation that the seeded data will support application testing and demonstrations.
  - **What**: Perform validation checks:
    - Query key tables to verify record counts
    - Sample data to ensure it appears realistic
    - Test important relationships between tables
    - Verify that seeded data supports critical application features
    - Confirm data volumes are appropriate for testing
