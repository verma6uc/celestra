# Java Servlet Project Tasks

## Database Structure and Model Setup

- [x] **Analyze schema.sql file in the docs/db directory**
  - **Why**: Understanding the database schema is crucial before creating any models to ensure correct representation of data structures and relationships.
  - **What**: Review the SQL file at `/Users/nupurbhaisare/celestra-workspace/celestra/docs/db/schema.sql` to identify all tables, relationships, data types, and constraints.

- [x] **Create enum classes in the enums package**
  - **Why**: Enums provide type-safety for fixed sets of values in the database (like status types, categories, etc.).
  - **What**: For each enumerated type defined in the schema file, create a corresponding Java enum class in the enums package. Each enum should accurately represent the possible values from the schema.

- [x] **Create POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes in the model package**
  - **Why**: POJOs represent database tables as Java objects, allowing for object-oriented manipulation of database data.
  - **What**: Create a Java class for each table in the schema. Each class should have:
    - Private fields corresponding to table columns with appropriate data types
    - Getters and setters for each field
    - Constructors (default and parameterized)
    - toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods

- [x] **Verify completeness of enums and POJOs**
  - **Why**: Ensure all database entities are properly represented in the Java model before proceeding.
  - **What**: Cross-check the created enum and POJO classes against the schema.sql file to confirm that all tables, columns, relationships, and enum values have been properly implemented.

## Database Connection Setup

- [x] **Create application.properties file**
  - **Why**: Externalize database configuration for easier maintenance and deployment across different environments.
  - **What**: Create a properties file that includes:
    - Database URL
    - Username and password
    - Connection pool settings
    - Any other database-specific parameters

- [x] **Implement Database Utility class**
  - **Why**: Centralize database connection management to avoid code duplication and ensure consistent handling of connections.
  - **What**: Create a utility class that:
    - Loads configuration from application.properties
    - Provides methods to obtain and release database connections
    - Implements connection pooling for better performance
    - Includes error handling for database connection issues

## Data Access Layer Implementation

- [ ] **Review feature requirements**
  - **Why**: Understanding the required features is essential before implementing data access objects.
  - **What**: Read and analyze the documents in `/Users/nupurbhaisare/celestra-workspace/celestra/docs/features` to understand what operations each DAO needs to support.

- [ ] **Create DAO (Data Access Object) classes for each POJO**
  - **Why**: DAOs separate business logic from database access code, providing a clean API for database operations.
  - **What**: For each POJO, create a corresponding DAO class that:
    - Implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - Includes any specialized queries needed for the features
    - Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
    - Properly handles resources (connections, statements, result sets)
    - Implements transaction management where needed
    - Ensures proper handling of enum values by correctly casting between Java enum types and database representations (string or integer values) in both query parameters and result processing; this includes converting Java enum values to the appropriate database type when setting parameters, casting database values back to corresponding Java enum types when retrieving results, and handling potential null or invalid enum values

- [ ] **Verify completeness of DAO classes**
  - **Why**: Ensure all required database operations are implemented before testing.
  - **What**: Review each DAO implementation against the feature requirements to confirm all necessary operations are supported and enum values are properly handled.

## Testing

- [ ] **Create test classes for each DAO**
  - **Why**: Verify that each DAO correctly implements the required operations and interacts properly with the database.
  - **What**: For each DAO, create a test class in the test package that:
    - Contains a main method as the entry point
    - Includes test cases for all DAO methods
    - Sets up test data
    - Executes each method and verifies results
    - Tests enum value conversions to ensure they work correctly in both directions
    - Cleans up test data to avoid affecting other tests
    - Outputs clear success/failure information
